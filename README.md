# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Data Analytics Project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL, Power-BI
# 👨🏻‍💻Customer Behavior Data Analyst Portfolio Project
This project represents a complete, industry standard, end-to-end data analytics workflow, designed to mirror the real responsibilities of professional analysts in modern business environments. The project encompasses all critical stages of data analysis, from data preparation and modeling to insight generation, visualization, and reporting.


## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

✅ Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

✅ Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.


## 📁 Dataset

File: customer_shopping_behavior.csv
Content: Includes features such as customer ID, purchase details, product attributes, and purchase timestamps
The dataset was used to explore customer behaviors, uncover purchasing trends, and derive key metrics. Data quality checks (e.g., missing values, consistency) were performed as part of the cleaning process.

## 🔍 Project Steps

1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration
Loaded dataset using Python (Pandas)
Inspected structure, data types, and summary statistics
Visualized distributions and patterns

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified trends (purchase frequency, category performance)
Analyzed relationships between variables
Created descriptive visualizations

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation
Handled missing and inconsistent entries
Standardized formats and renamed columns
Prepared cleaned dataset for analysis

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
